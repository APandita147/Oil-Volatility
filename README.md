# Oil-Volatility

From the abstract:

It is a layman belief that macroeconomic performance affects oil price stability and not the other
way around. This paper attempts to empirically investigate how Crude Oil Price Volatility affects
the two pillars of macroeconomic performance i.e., Inflation and GDP Growth in the case of the
United States of America. The study uses a Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) system in Python and
undertakes a combination of Granger Causality Tests for the period of January 2017 -
September 2021 using monthly data points. We find that there exists a bi-directional causal
relationship between real GDP growth and oil volatility, while inflation did not express
empirically any relationship with the above variables. We then discuss theoretical evidence to
bolster our empirical findings and analyze them thoroughly.
